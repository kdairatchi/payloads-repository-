# XSS Payloads Repository

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads. These payloads can be used for testing web applications for XSS vulnerabilities, which include stored, reflected, DOM-based, and advanced variations. The payloads are organized into separate files for easy navigation and use.

**Disclaimer**: These payloads are intended for educational purposes only. Always ensure you have explicit permission before testing any web application. Unauthorized usage may be illegal and unethical.
